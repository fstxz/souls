An (incomplete) open source implementation of the Soulseek server. Currently, it doesn't do anything useful, but it's possible to connect to the server from a Soulseek client (only tested with Nicotine+).

New users are created automatically upon connecting.

Thanks to Nicotine+ people for maintaining the [Soulseek protocol documentation](https://github.com/nicotine-plus/nicotine-plus/blob/master/doc/SLSKPROTOCOL.md).
